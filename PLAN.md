# Project Plan

1.  **Create initial project management files:**
    *   Create `PLAN.md` and populate it with this initial plan.
    *   Create an empty `TODO.md`.
    *   Create an empty `CHANGELOG.md`.
2.  **Understand Keynote file format:**
    *   Read `format_documentation/format_documentation.md` to get a deeper understanding of the Keynote file format.
3.  **Analyze build process and dependencies:**
    *   Examine `CMakeLists.txt` (root) and `keynote_lib/CMakeLists.txt`.
    *   Examine `build.sh`.
    *   Note down dependencies and their versions if specified.
4.  **Code Review and Refinement (Iterative Process):**
    *   **Identify areas for improvement:** Based on the understanding from previous steps, look for opportunities to enhance elegance, efficiency, and functionality. This could involve:
        *   Refactoring complex code sections.
        *   Optimizing performance-critical parts.
        *   Improving error handling and logging.
        *   Enhancing modularity and code organization.
    *   **Implement changes:** Make the identified improvements.
    *   **Update documentation:** Keep `README.md` and any other relevant documentation in sync with code changes.
    *   **Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`:** Reflect the progress and any new tasks.
    *   **Record changes in `CHANGELOG.md`:** Document all significant modifications.
5.  **Testing (if applicable):**
    *   The `README.md` mentions a command-line tool for testing. Explore its usage.
    *   If feasible, add or enhance tests for any significant changes made.
6.  **Final Review and Submission:**
    *   Review all changes, documentation, and project management files.
    *   Ensure the project builds correctly by running `build.sh`.
    *   Submit the changes.
